# mqIoTT
## Mqtt Web Server implemented using Spring Boot. 

I am in the process of splitting my [GarageDoor repository](https://github.com/isaacaflores2/GarageDoor) into
three seperate repositories (mqtt web server, android app, esp8266 arduino). This will allow me to update each aspect of my
iot mqiott independently and hopefully allow for better code reuse.
